#### 4.3 Analytics & Insights
- [ ] User engagement dashboard
- [ ] Activity participation tracking

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "Sign In" on landing page
2. Redirect to WorkOS AuthKit
3. User authenticates (Google OAuth or email/password)
4. WorkOS redirects to /auth/callback?code=...
5. Exchange code for user profile + access token
6. Create session, store in cookie
7. Create/update user in user-db
8. Redirect to /dashboard

### Recommendation Algorithm
1. Fetch user profile (interests, limitations, social preferences)
2. Fetch user's calendar blocks from user-db
3. Query activity-db for matching activities
4. Score activities based on:
   - Interest alignment (vector similarity if using embeddings)
   - Difficulty vs. physical capability
   - Social size preference
   - Schedule availability
   - Variety (don't over-recommend same category)
5. Generate balanced weekly schedule (2-3 activities)
6. Save to recommendations table with explanation

### Conversation Memory
- **Working Memory**: Current conversation session
- **Episodic Memory**: Past conversations, activity feedback
- **Semantic Memory**: User preferences, patterns learned over time

Use SmartMemory search to retrieve relevant context for each message.

## Environment Variables Needed

```bash
# WorkOS
WORKOS_API_KEY=
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=

# Google Calendar API
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

# App Config
APP_URL=https://svc-01k8r81ngamv5ny0gerqayh5dh.01k8eade5c6qxmxhttgr2hn2nz.lmapp.run
SESSION_SECRET=
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- User profile CRUD operations
- Activity matching algorithm
- Calendar conflict detection

### Integration Tests
- Auth flow end-to-end
- Recommendation generation with real DB
- AI chat with SmartInference

### Manual Testing
- Create test user accounts
- Test with various user profiles (different interests, limitations)
- Verify activity recommendations are appropriate
- Test calendar sync

## Deployment Process

1. Implement features in local environment
2. Test with `pnpm test`
3. Validate build with `raindrop build validate`
4. Deploy with `raindrop build deploy --amend --start`
5. Verify endpoints with curl/browser
6. Monitor logs with Raindrop CLI

## Success Metrics

**MVP Success:**
- User can sign up, create profile, and view dashboard
- System generates 2-3 personalized activity recommendations per week
- User can chat with AI and receive activity suggestions
- At least 5 beta users trying the system

**Full Launch:**
- 100+ active users in Indianapolis area
- 50+ activities in database across all categories
- 70%+ user satisfaction with recommendations
- Average 2+ activities completed per user per week
